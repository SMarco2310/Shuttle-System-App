# 🚍 Shuttle Booking System

This is a shuttle booking system built to streamline and modernize the shuttle process at my school. Instead of relying on manual lists or word-of-mouth, students can now book their shuttle seats easily through a web application — with instant payments and email confirmations.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

The aim of this project is to **simplify** and **digitize** the shuttle booking process on campus, allowing students to:

- Browse available shuttles
- Book seats in advance
- Pay using MTN MoMo
- Receive email receipts instantly
- And avoid overbooking or missing their ride

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

This system is built as **modular services**:

- **Auth Service** — handles registration/login with JWT
- **Booking Service** — processes bookings, coordinates payment & shuttles
- **Shuttle Service** — manages all shuttle buses, routes, capacity, etc.
- **Payment Service** — integrates MoMo STK Push
- **Email Service** — sends receipts via Nodemailer

Each service can run independently or be wired together via an **API Gateway**.
